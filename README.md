In the third course of the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization, you will:

Explore the applications of GANs and examine them wrt data augmentation, privacy, and anonymity
Leverage the image-to-image translation framework and identify applications to modalities beyond images
Implement Pix2Pix, a paired image-to-image translation GAN, to adapt satellite images into map routes (and vice versa)
Compare paired image-to-image translation to unpaired image-to-image translation and identify how their key difference necessitates different GAN architectures
Implement CycleGAN, an unpaired image-to-image translation model, to adapt horses to zebras (and vice versa) with two GANs in one
Apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
